# DNS-Configuration-Lab
This lab involved setting up and managing DNS services on a Windows Server VM. The objective was to understand internal name resolution, zone creation, and DNS record management.

Technologies Used
- Windows Server (DNS role)
- DNS Manager
- Command Prompt / nslookup

What I Did
1. Installed the DNS role on a domain controller
2. Created forward and reverse lookup zones
3. Added A, PTR, and CNAME records
4. Tested name resolution using `nslookup` and ping
5. Configured conditional forwarders and monitored replication

6. Screenshots
See the `/screenshots` folder for all configuration steps.
